# Configurable-Ubracket-OpenSCAD
 OpenSCAD file to make a u-bracket. My efforts at exporting from Sketchup to an STL led me to learning OpenSCAD. I'm glad I did. This little program lets you configure height, width, "wing" size and plants a hole in the center of the wings.

 This screen shot is from Chitubox.
